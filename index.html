        In this game you have to collect as many score as you can. There are
        seven stages from easiest to hardest which is called 'Final Stage' and
        it's hardest of them all. every other stage got lower time cooldown so
        that makes it harder. You have to type as fast as you can and hit enter
        that will add time to counter and make game easier for you. Compete to
        other players. Good luck!
